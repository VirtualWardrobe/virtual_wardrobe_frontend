## 🧑‍💻 Frontend Highlights

The frontend was completely re-engineered in **Version 2.0** using **Next.js with TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**, offering a modern, responsive, and performant UI. Key improvements:

- **Server-side rendering** for faster initial load times and SEO benefits.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, maintainable styling.
- **Dynamic outfit filtering** and search for quick discovery.
- **Virtual Try-On** integration with the backend.
- **Mobile-first** design approach for an optimized user experience across devices.

This revamp replaces the basic HTML, CSS, and JS used in the first version.
